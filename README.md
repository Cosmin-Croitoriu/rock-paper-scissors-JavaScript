## Rock Paper Scissors - JavaScript


I am trying trough this project to refresh my knowledge of Vanilla Javascript, by doing something fun.

#### HTML elements and CSS styling


I started by creating the Html elements needed. I found and downloaded the appropriate icons (png files) for the Rock, Paper, Scissors. Then I have used CSS to style all the Html elements.

#### JavaScriot
 
 I, initially, declared and assigned, without Jquery, all the element classes and ids from the index page. 
 Afterword I have created 3 methods, for each buttopn to test with 'console.log' if clicking the buttons will work, 
   then I incorporated all 3 into a 'main' function, 
   and instead of console.log, to call a 'game' function that will have as an argument the button that has been pressed as a string( "r", "p", "s"). 
 In a separate function I have created the computer random selection.
